        listening to music is my hobby. I usually listening <br>
        music when when I do not have anything to do. I <br>
        My favorite music genre is light music because <br>
        it helps me relieve stress and it help me relax. Sometimes <br>
        I usually go to concerts because I can meet new friends with <br>
        the same interests as me.  My favorite singer is Son Tung-MTP. <br>
        I like him because his voice is so good. <br>

        There are a lot of paintings on the wall, service there is very good and the <br>
        staff there is very friendly. The prices there are very suitable for students. <br>
        The menu there is very diverse, it has hotpot, fried chicken, coffee and other <br>
        drinks and snacks. My favourite snack there is Chocolate ice cream. It is very <br>
        cool and sweet. My favourite drink is white coffee because it has a special taste. <br>

        tools for me to work and study. i use  it in all my studies, learn english <br>
        and entertain. i often have some problems when working with it, <br>
        Its  battery runs out quickly and it is slow. i like its design, and it facilitates my <br>
